# Executive Risk Summary – NIST CSF Assessment

## Purpose
This document provides a management-level summary of cybersecurity risk identified during a NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) assessment of a Windows 11 endpoint. It is intended to inform leadership decision-making by translating technical control gaps into business-relevant risk.

## Assessment Overview
- **Framework Used:** NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- **Scope:** Single Windows 11 endpoint (virtualized)
- **Assessment Type:** Control gap and risk identification
- **Assessment Focus:** Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover functions

The assessment evaluated whether foundational cybersecurity controls were present, documented, and effective within the defined scope.

## Overall Risk Posture
The overall risk posture of the assessed environment is **Moderate to High** due to gaps in detection, response, and recovery capabilities.

Preventive controls were partially present; however, the lack of centralized monitoring, formal incident response procedures, and recovery planning increases the likelihood that security incidents could go undetected or unmanaged.

## Key Risk Themes Identified

### 1. Detection and Monitoring Gaps
- No centralized logging or continuous monitoring capability
- Reliance on local event logs limits visibility and timely detection
- Increases risk of delayed incident identification

**Business Impact:**  
Security incidents may persist longer before detection, increasing operational and reputational risk.

### 2. Incident Response Preparedness
- No formally documented incident response procedures
- Containment and escalation processes are informal or manual
- Response actions depend heavily on individual knowledge

**Business Impact:**  
Inconsistent or delayed response during security incidents may increase impact and recovery time.

### 3. Asset and Configuration Management
- Asset and software visibility achieved through ad-hoc scanning
- No documented configuration baseline for endpoint security
- Increased exposure to unpatched or misconfigured systems

**Business Impact:**  
Higher likelihood of exploitable vulnerabilities and configuration drift over time.

### 4. Recovery and Resilience Planning
- Limited documentation for recovery procedures
- No formal lessons-learned or improvement cycle defined

**Business Impact:**  
Extended downtime and slower recovery following security incidents.

## Risk Summary by Severity

| Risk Level | Number of Risks |
|----------|----------------|
| High | 3 |
| Medium | 3 |
| Low | 0 |

The highest risks are concentrated in **Detect** and **Respond** functions of the NIST CSF.

## Recommended Risk Treatment Approach
Leadership should prioritize mitigation strategies that strengthen visibility and response capabilities:

- Implement centralized logging and monitoring
- Establish documented incident response procedures
- Define containment and escalation workflows
- Formalize asset inventory and configuration baselines
- Introduce recovery documentation and review processes

These actions focus on **risk reduction**, not complete risk elimination.

## Conclusion
This assessment highlights that cybersecurity risk is driven not only by technical vulnerabilities but also by gaps in process, visibility, and response readiness.

Addressing the identified risks will significantly improve the organization’s ability to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents while supporting compliance and audit readiness.

## Executive Note
This risk summary demonstrates how technical control assessments can be translated into actionable business risk, supporting informed decision-making at the leadership level.
